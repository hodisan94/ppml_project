## Abstract

This document describes the methodology and implementation of a comprehensive security evaluation comparing traditional unprotected machine learning inference against Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) protected execution in healthcare contexts. We implement and evaluate memory extraction attacks that target sensitive healthcare model parameters and patient data, demonstrating quantifiable protection improvements through hardware-enforced trusted execution environments.

## 1. Introduction and Motivation

### 1.1 Healthcare ML Security Challenges

Healthcare machine learning systems face unique security challenges due to the dual sensitivity of their inputs (patient medical data) and outputs (proprietary prediction models). Traditional computing environments expose critical vulnerabilities:

- **Data Breach Impact**: Healthcare data breaches cost an average of $10.93 million per incident [1]
- **Regulatory Requirements**: HIPAA, GDPR, and FDA regulations mandate strict data protection
- **Model IP Protection**: Healthcare ML models represent significant intellectual property investments
- **Inference-Time Attacks**: Runtime data exposure during model inference operations

### 1.2 Threat Model

Our evaluation targets a **privileged adversary** with the following capabilities:
- Root access to the host operating system
- Ability to read arbitrary process memory via system interfaces
- Knowledge of target process memory layout and data structures
- Access to debugging and introspection tools

This threat model aligns with realistic scenarios including:
- Malicious system administrators
- Compromised cloud infrastructure
- Advanced persistent threats (APTs)
- Insider threats with elevated privileges

## 2. Background: Intel SGX Technology

### 2.1 SGX Architecture Overview

Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) provides hardware-enforced **Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)** through:

- **Encrypted Page Cache (EPC)**: Hardware-encrypted memory regions inaccessible to privileged software
- **Memory Encryption Engine (MEE)**: Transparent AES-128 encryption with integrity verification
- **Access Control**: CPU-enforced isolation preventing OS/hypervisor access to enclave memory
- **Remote Attestation**: Cryptographic proof of genuine SGX execution and code integrity

### 2.2 SGX Security Guarantees

SGX provides protection against:
- **Memory extraction attacks** targeting sensitive runtime data
- **Privileged malware** including rootkits and kernel-level threats  
- **Physical attacks** such as cold boot attacks on DRAM
- **Hypervisor-based attacks** in cloud environments

**Key Limitation**: SGX does not protect against side-channel attacks, though hardware countermeasures exist for many variants.

## 3. Attack Methodology and Implementation

### 3.1 Memory Extraction Attack

**Attack Vector**: Direct Process Memory Reading via `/proc/[pid]/mem`

**Technical Implementation**:
```python
def extract_memory_patterns(pid):
    """Extract floating-point patterns from process memory"""
    with open(f"/proc/{pid}/mem", "rb") as mem:
        with open(f"/proc/{pid}/maps", "r") as maps:
            for region in parse_writable_regions(maps):
                mem.seek(region.start_addr)
                data = mem.read(region.size)
                yield extract_float_patterns(data)
```

**Academic Foundation**: This attack builds on established memory extraction techniques:
- **Halderman et al. (2008)**: "Lest We Remember: Cold Boot Attacks on Encryption Keys" [2]
- **Frigo et al. (2018)**: "Grand Pwning Unit: Accelerating Microarchitectural Attacks with the GPU" [3]

**Target Data Types**:
1. **ML Model Coefficients**: Logistic regression weights stored as IEEE 754 floats
2. **Patient Features**: Normalized medical data values in inference pipelines
3. **Intermediate Computations**: Temporary values during model execution

### 3.2 Process Memory Analysis Attack

**Attack Vector**: Runtime Process Introspection

**Technical Implementation**:
```python
def analyze_process_memory(pid):
    """Analyze process memory layout and accessible regions"""
    process = psutil.Process(pid)
    memory_maps = process.memory_maps()
    return {
        'writable_regions': count_writable_regions(memory_maps),
        'heap_size': calculate_heap_size(memory_maps),
        'ml_frameworks': detect_ml_libraries(process)
    }
```

## 4. SGX Protection Implementation

### 4.1 Gramine LibOS Integration

We utilize **Gramine** (formerly Graphene-SGX) as our LibOS to enable SGX execution of unmodified applications:

**Key Features**:
- Transparent SGX application porting without source code modification
- POSIX API compatibility for standard Python/ML workloads
- Automatic enclave memory management and file system abstraction
- Built-in attestation and secure communication support

**Academic Reference**: 
- **Tsai et al. (2017)**: "Graphene-SGX: A Practical Library OS for Unmodified Applications on SGX" [6]

### 4.2 Manifest Configuration

**Critical Security Configuration**:
```toml
# SGX Enclave Configuration
sgx.enclave_size = "512M"          # Dedicated encrypted memory
sgx.max_threads = 16               # Controlled execution environment
sgx.debug = true                   # Development mode (disable for production)

# Trusted Files (Measured and Protected)
sgx.trusted_files = [
    "file:{{ gramine.libos }}",     # Gramine runtime
    "file:/usr/bin/python3",       # Python interpreter
    "file:healthcare_model.pkl",   # ML model parameters
    "file:patient_data.pkl",       # Input data
]

# File System Isolation
fs.mounts = [
    { path = "/lib", uri = "file:/lib" },
    { path = "/tmp", type = "tmpfs" },  # Ephemeral storage
]
```

### 4.3 Memory Protection Verification

**Protection Verification Strategy**:
1. **Enclave Initialization**: Verify successful SGX enclave creation
2. **Memory Region Analysis**: Compare accessible memory regions (vulnerable: ~400+ regions, SGX: ~2 regions)
3. **Data Extraction Testing**: Apply identical attack techniques to protected process
4. **Attestation Verification**: Confirm genuine SGX execution through hardware attestation
