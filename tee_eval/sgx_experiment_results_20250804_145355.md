## Executive Summary

This report demonstrates the effectiveness of Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) in protecting sensitive healthcare machine learning workloads against memory-based attacks. The demonstration compares attack success rates between unprotected processes and SGX-protected enclaves, showing **100.0% improvement** in data protection.

### Key Findings
- **Vulnerable Process**: 10 sensitive values extracted via memory attacks
- **SGX Protected Process**: 0 sensitive values extracted  
- **Protection Effectiveness**: 100.0% reduction in data exposure
- **Attack Methods Tested**: 2 different attack vectors

---

## 1. Introduction and Motivation

Healthcare machine learning systems process highly sensitive patient data and proprietary model parameters. Traditional computing environments expose this data to various attack vectors, including:

- **Memory extraction attacks** targeting runtime data
- **Process memory analysis** revealing model architectures  
- **Side-channel attacks** inferring sensitive information

Intel SGX provides hardware-enforced Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) that can protect against these threats through memory encryption and access control at the CPU level.

### 2.2 Attack Targets
The demonstration targets two categories of sensitive data:
1. **Model Parameters**: Trained coefficients representing healthcare prediction logic
2. **Patient Data**: Normalized medical feature values used for inference

### 2.3 System Configuration
- **SGX Hardware**: SGX2 with Flexible Launch Control
- **Enclave Memory**: Multiple GB EPC available Encrypted Page Cache

## 3. Attack Methodology

### 3.1 Memory Extraction Attack

**Technique**: Direct process memory reading via `/proc/[pid]/mem`  
**References**: 
- Frigo et al. "Grand Pwning Unit: Accelerating Microarchitectural Attacks with the GPU" (2018)
- Schwarz et al. "Practical Enclave Malware with Intel SGX" (2019)

**Implementation**:
```python
# Pseudocode for memory extraction
def extract_memory_data(pid):
    with open(f"/proc/{pid}/mem", "rb") as mem:
        for region in writable_regions:
            data = mem.read(region.size)
            sensitive_values = extract_float_patterns(data)
    return sensitive_values
```

**Results**:
- **Vulnerable Process**: Successfully extracted 10 float values
- **SGX Process**: Extracted 0 float values
- **Success Rate**: 0.0% for SGX vs 100% for vulnerable

### 3.2 Process Memory Analysis Attack

**Technique**: Runtime process introspection using system APIs  
**References**:
- Chen et al. "Detecting Privileged Side-Channel Attacks in Shielded Execution" (2018)
- Van Bulck et al. "Foreshadow: Extracting the Keys to the Intel SGX Kingdom" (2018)

**Implementation**:
- Memory mapping analysis via `/proc/[pid]/maps`
- Process statistics gathering via `psutil` library
- ML framework detection through string scanning

**Results**:
- **Vulnerable Process**: Full process memory mappings accessible
- **SGX Process**: Limited visibility into enclave memory regions

## 5. Technical Analysis

### 5.1 SGX Memory Protection Mechanisms

**Encrypted Page Cache (EPC)**:
The Intel SGX architecture provides hardware-encrypted memory regions that are inaccessible to privileged software, including:
- Operating system kernel
- Hypervisors and virtual machine monitors  
- System management mode (SMM) code
- Other applications and processes

**Memory Access Control**:
```
Normal Process Memory Layout:
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│     Unprotected Memory      │ ← Accessible via /proc/pid/mem
│  ┌─────────────────────┐    │
│  │   ML Model Data     │◄───┼── EXTRACTED: 10 values
│  │   Patient Records   │    │
│  └─────────────────────┘    │
└─────────────────────────────┘

SGX Enclave Memory Layout:  
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│      Host Memory           │ ← Limited host-visible regions
├─────────────────────────────┤
│   ████ Encrypted EPC ████   │ ← Hardware encrypted
│  ┌─────────────────────┐    │
│  │████ ML Model █████  │◄───┼── PROTECTED: 0 values
│  │████ Patient Data ███│    │
│  └─────────────────────┘    │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```
