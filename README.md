# Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning (PPML) Project

This project demonstrates a privacy-preserving ML pipeline using federated learning, differential privacy, and trusted execution environments (TEEs) with Enarx.

## Structure

- `data/`: Data preprocessing scripts
- `models/`: Logistic regression implementation
- `federated/`: Federated learning client/server code
- `privacy/`: Differential privacy utilities
- `tee/`: Enarx-related scripts and Wasm modules
- `attacks/`: Attack simulations (e.g., MIA, inversion)
- `utils/`: Shared utility functions
- `main.py`: Entry point script

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
